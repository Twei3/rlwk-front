								<p><b>Eligibility</b>: This is an Open Call for participants. Selection of participants will be based on their experience (up to 10 years post-PhD experience), relevance of their research to the workshop, motivation and ability to disseminate the workshop’s outcomes. </p>
								<p>The British Council Researcher Links’ programme
									provides opportunities for early career researchers
									(ECRs) from the UK and internationally to interact,
									learn from each other and explore opportunities
									for building long-lasting research collaborations.
									During the workshop, early career researchers
									have the opportunity to present their research in the
									form of a short oral presentation and discuss it with
									established researchers and other ECRs. There is
									a focus on building up links for future collaborations.</p>

								<h2>About the workshop</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Respiratory disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with infants and young children especially susceptible. It is a leading cause of death in infants and children, particularly in middle and low income countries. </p>
							<p>The economic consequences of poor respiratory health in childhood, are substantial. Effective techniques for prevention, diagnosis and management of childhood respiratory disease can significantly reduce overall and lung-specific mortality in children and adults.</p>
							<p>This workshop will share our understanding of epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of childhood respiratory diseases in UK and in China. Initial observations will form the basis of future collaborative research studies. </p>
							<p>Recommendations from this workshop for the development of novel laboratory and clinical research programmes will lead to highly collaborative, interdisciplinary networks between UK and China.</p>


							<header>
								<h2>Draft Workshop Agenda</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The 4-day workshop consists of four key themes all related to childhood respiratory disease in UK and China: 1) epidemiology 2) diagnosis and management 3) novel translational methods and 4) new research directions. </p>
							<p>The workshop will provide a unique opportunity for sharing research expertise and networking. During the workshops, early career researchers will have the opportunity to present their research in the form of a poster/short oral presentation and discuss this with established researchers from the UK and partner countries.</p>
